# func-adl-servicex-demos
 Some simple notebooks coming from questions from the community

## Running

As these are demos they are mostly run from jupyter notebooks. Most have been run from `vscode` using its jupyter notebook interface.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment however you normally do!
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## The demos

Most of the names are self explanatory!

## Notes

If you see something like `dev_atlas` for a backend name, that means we forgot to remove the `dev_` because we were running on a local development instance of servicex to better debug it.
